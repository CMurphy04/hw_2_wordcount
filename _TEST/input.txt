How old is C++?

Here is some history!
 In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.
 The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his thesis.
 Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development,
 but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable
 for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem
 of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his experience,
 Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was
 general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages
 also influenced C++, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
